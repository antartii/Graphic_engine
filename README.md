# Anta's Graphic Engine

Anta's Graphic Engine is an open-source project designed to assist developers in creating software with a graphical interface.
The primary goal of this project is to provide a highly customizable and easy-to-use tool for various types of graphical applications.

Our team currently follows 3 motto :
- Always be open to learning new things and trying new stuff
- Pushing ourselves to our limits (could be by redoing an entire set of our code)
- Trying our best to be understandable by everyone (by making detailed documentation, tutorials and helping each other)

## Features

The engine have the following components:

- C++ Core Class: Serves as the engine's core, awaiting plugins to render graphics.
- Basic Classes: Includes fundamental classes such as Size and  Coordinates to manage spatial concepts.
- Main Program (main.cpp): Launches the program and allows you to set up your plugins.

## Plugins

Currently there are two maintained plugins:

- **Shapes2D**
    Adds support for 2D shapes including lines, triangles, quads, and polygons shapes.
- **Game**
    Simulates basic game engine functions such as initialization and updates.
    Includes a game manager for handling game logic.

## Contributing

We would be pleased to have you contributing ! We are currently a team of 1 dev on the project, and the team could need a little help on many things :
    - An help on optimizing our code to not end up doing spaghetti code (oh no we don't want that !)
    - An help for english grammatical & wordings mistakes (Sorry the current dev is french and try his best !)
    - Ideas on interesting features ! (Anything will do !)
