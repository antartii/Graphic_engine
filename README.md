# Anta’s graphic engine

*This program is coded, compiled and released for `Fedora release 38` for the time being. We currently don’t know if the program is compatible with other OS and we do not offer support for other OS than the `Fedora release 38` . Please be aware while using this program on other OS, it could end up with unexpected behavior.*

notes : here is the point we need help :

**At the moment :**

**Every time :**

- Optimizing (even micro optimizations are great !)
- Improving readability (functions names, variables names, etc…)
- Code architecture (file architecture, class & function dependencies)
- Documentation (tutorial, fix grammatical & orthographical errors, translating our documentation)

Anta’s graphic engine is a set of tools originally created for make easier the creation of software that needs a visual user interface, while keeping an open-source and easy to modify program.

The developpement team of the project follows 3 rules :

- Keeping everything clear, easy to read and open to ideas
- Optimizing the more that we can think of (less space used, lower CPU/GPU usage, organizing functions and datas)
- Always improving (by trying new ways of doing things, doing things even if it’s hard, etc…)
